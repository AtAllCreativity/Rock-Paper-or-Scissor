# Rock-Paper-or-Scissor
A simple game played with UI instead of terminal.

My own bjectives of this project was:
 - Usage of "DOMContentLoaded".
 - Function getElementById.
 - FunctionAddEventListiner.
 - Function querySelectorAll.
 - Usage of if statements.
 - Usage of for loop.

The whole commit since the beginning of this project was created under the repository "projects". Since my goal is to have various projects, 
every single project will have its on repository.
